## Multi-object Detection With Deep Learning 

This rep is to solve multi object detection with deep neural networks.

I will start off by implementing the YOLO network proposed by Joseph Redmon. From here on, I will increase the complexity of architecture by implementing sub systems such as spatial transformer network, attention transformers, feature pyramid network, so on and so forth.
